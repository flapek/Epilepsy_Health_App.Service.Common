# Joint [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flapek/Joint.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/flapek/Joint)

## Welcome to Joint

Joint is a set of **helper libraries** that can be most of the time (with some exceptions) **used independently of each other** to help you to build your web applications and microservices. **Joint is neither a framework nor a silver bullet.**

Quite opposite, **itâ€™s mostly the set of extensions methods along with additional abstractions** that will help you to deal with common infrastructural concerns.
